# Quadcopter

Welcome to my Quadcopter Build Project! This repository documents the journey of creating a fully functional quadcopter from the ground up. This project encompasses the design and development of both a custom remote controller and a flight controller, showcasing the integration of hardware and software to achieve seamless flight operations.



## Overview
In this project, I aimed to explore the principles of quadcopter design, including aerodynamics, electronics, and programming. By building the quadcopter from scratch, I gained hands-on experience with various components and technologies, from selecting the right motors and propellers to coding the flight control algorithms.
## Key Features
* Custom Quadcopter Frame: Designed and 3D printed a lightweight yet durable frame tailored for stability and agility.

* Remote Controller: Developed a user-friendly remote controller, featuring an intuitive interface for precise control.

* Flight Controller: Programmed a flight controller with advanced stabilization algorithms, enabling smooth and responsive flight.

* Telemetry Integration: Incorporated real-time telemetry for monitoring performance and flight data.

* Modular Design: Ensured easy access to components for maintenance and upgrades.
